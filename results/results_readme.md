# Results 
The results from running our script and completing correlation analysis on the output
can be found in `random-subset-correlation-analysis.xlsx`.
The sheets provide different information:
- `scenario features` : this details the scenarios randomly selected and their 
corresponding feature values.
- `sorting` : use this sheet to sort / filter on the data with diversity and demand
results as it is not referenced elsewhere in the sheet.
- `data` : these are the diversity and demand calculation outputs from running our
script alongside the pre-existing values for collision event and collision probability.
- `correlation diversity collision` : correlation analysis for diversity and collision
probability / event outcome.
- `correlation demand collision` : correlation analysis for demand and collision
probability / event outcome.
Refer to `plots` folder for visualisation of these results.
